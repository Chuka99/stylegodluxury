## What is soft luxury?
Soft luxury is a mindset: polished pieces, quiet colors, and intentional details.

### 1) Build your clean base
Choose neutrals: black, cream, chocolate, wine. Keep lines simple.

### 2) Add one rich texture
Satin, structured knit, velvet, or a crisp blazer.

### 3) Hair + accessories complete the look
Sleek hair, minimal jewelry, and a structured bag = instant elevation.
